** Install Notebook Environment
clone the repository and run:
#+begin_example
$ conda env create -f mrg.yaml
#+end_example
set up a notebook server and kernel as usual and proceed.

notebooks are available both as ipython notebooks and as org notebooks.
** Alternatively, use Development Environment on Nanohub
1. navigate to https://nanohub.org/tools/jupyter70/
2. start a terminal and clone the respository.
3. use the nanoHUB jupyter browser to start the mrsicms kernel from the "new" dropdown menu on the right.
4. develop in a notebook online
*** Note on using a jupyter REPL
in order to access the kernel through an interactive shell:
1. start an in-browser terminal (does not work through ssh)
2. $ use -e anaconda-7
3. $ jupyter console --existing
** Manually Recreating mrg Env
These are just notes on what worked for me once. This should not be necessary to do.
1. conda install -c intel intel-aikit
2. conda update scipy
3. conda install -c intel mkl=2021.4.0
4. pip install git+https://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/cmcl.git
5. pip install git+https://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/yogi.git
6. pip install git+https://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/spyglass.git
* Tutorial Brief
Methods rooted in data science, machine learning, and artificial
intelligence have become necessary components of materials design
endeavors, being frequently applied in conjunction with both
computational and experimental data. The now thriving field of materials
informatics has seen the accelerated discovery of new battery materials,
solar cell absorbers, thermoelectrics, and routes for autonomous
synthesis and characterization. The need to educate and train the
materials science workforce on the essential elements of machine
learning has never been greater. This proposal aims to establish a
recurring series of tutorials at MRS spring and fall meetings that
introduce newcomers to all the basic concepts of machine learning in
materials science, walking them through a few interactive examples that
use existing datasets and ML resources.

In this tutorial, there will be short overview presentations of several
key ML concepts, following which the presenter and audience will
together work through Python notebooks that contain easy-to-follow
examples from the literature. The audience will likely constitute
undergraduate and graduate students looking to get started with
materials informatics, but the tutorial will be welcome and useful for
any researcher. Some familiarity with writing code and making plots in
Python would be useful.

Prerequisites: Basic familiarity with Python and some data science,
basic background do materials science and engineering / materials
design.
